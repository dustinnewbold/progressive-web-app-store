Display a list of progressive web apps.
Allow users to access them and rate them.
During rating, capture device or allow dropdown of device based on rating
	- This is so ratings reflect device support
	- Perhaps part of review, allow rating based on how well app worked
		- "Worked Beautifully"
		- "Minor Bugs"
		- "Major Bugs"
		- "Complete crashing or not a PWA"
There wouldn't really be versioning of a PWA, so maybe allow filtering of ratings by date (last 90 days)
Initially I would be supplying the data (similar to pwa.rocks).
Store in a local database (nosql or sql)
Backend would provide feeds
App should be PWA as well
Allow filtering based on name and current browser support
Allow people to claim a PWA to manage it
	- Display an "author" if someone claimed PWA. Leave blank otherwise
